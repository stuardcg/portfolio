            My first project as a software developer. I was a solo developer on
            charge of the development of a web application that allows lawyers
            to generate word documents with the information of their clients. I
            was responsible for the development of the backend and frontend,
            testing, and deployment. Definitely a great and challenging
            experience that I'm glad I had.

          <p>
            Another big solo project. This time I was in charge of the full
            development of a web application that allows companies to generate
            invoices and send them to their clients. I was responsible for the
            development of the backend and frontend, testing, and deployment.
            The app have to use the Costa Rican government API to generate the
            invoices and send them to the clients, saving the invoices in for a
            period of time. This is the project that I'm most proud of because
            here is were I decided to never stop learning. This was my
            introduction to the world of modern web development with React.

          <p>
            I built multiple web applications for a sports betting companies.
            This time I wasn't alone, I was part of different teams with
            different levels of experience. Our team was in charge of the
            development of a web application that allows users to compare the
            odds of different sports betting companies in real-time. I was
            responsible for the development of the frontend. I learned a lot
            about React and GraphQL in this project and way more about teamwork,
            so much that I ended up being the team lead.
